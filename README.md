# Module_15 - RoboAdvisors

As a digital transformation consultant for one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country, I've been tasked to increase their client portfolio --- especially by engaging young people.  Because machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve the customer experience, I've decided to create a robo advisor.  Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

## Initial Configured Robo Advisor

Quicktime Movies of user dialogues with the Robo Advisor are included in the Images folder.  One of the animations is for our initial Robo Advisor set up, while the other is the final product after we implemented our Lambda function.
